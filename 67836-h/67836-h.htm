POLITICAL PAMPHLETS, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<p>There cannot be a surer proof
of ignorance and folly than impertinence,
whether it betrays itself
in the pertness of a coxcomb,
or in the solemnity of a fop; provokes
with the petulance of wit; stupifies
with the dullness of narration; insults with
the arrogance of superior birth, fortune,
or learning; fatigues with frothy declamation,
or stuns with the clamour of dispute;
in private and in public, over a dish of
tea, or over a bottle; from the pulpit, or
the bar, or in the senate, it is always offensive
and ridiculous.</p>

<p>The humble and obscure writer of a
Pamphlet cannot, however, if he happens
to mistake his talents, be justly blamed for
impertinence. He may be pitied for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
misfortune; but for his faults as an author,
he is answerable to no man: for there
is scarce any man, who has dealt in this sort
of reading, that has not had fair warning;
it being more than an hundred to one, that
he has bought an impertinent Pamphlet,
some time, or other, in the course of his
studies. He cannot well fail of knowing
that such things are sometimes published;
neither the writer nor the bookseller compels
him to buy; and if he suffers himself
to be imposed on by a title-page, he
can have no good reason to complain of
either. Besides, no Pamphlet can fairly be
said to be wholly useless: it may be always
made to serve, at least, some purpose;
whereas I believe there is hardly any body
but may remember to have been present,
perhaps once in their lives, at a conversation,
or a pleading, or a speech, or a sermon,
that could serve no manner of purpose
but to tire the audience, and make
the speaker ridiculous: and this must be
allowed to be a very unpardonable sort of
impertinence; for a man may throw aside
a Pamphlet, if he pleases, at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
page, or the first line; but he cannot decently
get out of a company, or out of the
senate, or out of a church, whenever he
may have a mind.</p>

<p>I do not mean this, as an apology for
authors in general: the accidental writer
of a Pamphlet, or a Paper, hardly deserves
so respectable an appellation. On the
contrary, every man who wantonly and
vainly usurps that sacred profession, without
being possessed of a moderate share at
least, either of genius, or wit, or learning,
or knowledge, besides the indispensable qualifications
and ingredients of common honesty,
sincerity, and benevolence, is guilty,
in my opinion, of the highest degree of
impertinence.</p>

<p>But in this land of liberty, of general
wealth, curiosity, and idleness, where there
is scarce a human creature so poor that it
cannot afford to buy or hire a Paper or a
Pamphlet, or so busy that it cannot find
leisure to read it; where every man, woman,
and child, is, by instinct, birth, and
inheritance, a politician; where the ordinary
subjects of common conversation turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
not, as in most countries, upon the impertinent
trivial occurrences of the week
or the day, nor on the small concerns, offices,
and duties of private and social life; but
on the greater and the more important objects
of war, negociations, peace, laws,
and the public and general weal; where
men are more solicitous about the integrity
and abilities of a lord commissioner
of the treasury, or of a secretary of state,
than the fidelity of their own wives, the
chastity of their daughters, their sons, or
their own honour and virtue; and where,
like the virtuous citizens of Rome
and Sparta, they unreluctantly offer up all
the slenderer ties of blood, the endearments
of love, the connexions of friendship,
and the obligations of private gratitude,
daily sacrifices and victims to the
commonwealth; in such a country, the
dullest Pamphlet may have a fair chance of
gaining some readers, provided it be a political
Pamphlet; whilst a treatise on religion
or philosophy, unless the writer of it
should happen to be thoroughly master of
his subject, and know how to treat it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
uncommon genius and learning, would
meet with the fate it deserved, and be received
with universal neglect.</p>

<p>These are dry insipid studies, fit only for
the drudgery of a school or a college.
They are commonly laid aside with the
accidence or the grammar, are of little
use to a man in his commerce with the
world, and contribute rather to obstruct
the advancement of his interests and his
fortunes, than to promote them. There
are, besides, few men so unreasonably inquisitive
about these matters, as not to be
fully satisfied with the stock they have already
laid in, or who would not even
sooner consent perhaps, to forget half they
had ever learned, than to take the useless
or the dangerous pains of acquiring
more. The works of a Tillotson, or of a
Shaftesbury, of a Seneca, or a Marcus Antoninus,
may possibly be found amongst the
lumber of a bookseller’s warehouse; may
serve, like the works of the Fathers, to
fill up the vacant shelves of a large library;
or may, now and then, assist a clergyman
who happens to be ill, or engaged on a Saturday;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
but they are of little other use at
present. Formerly, indeed, they seem to
have been read and approved by here and
there a man; and some small encouragement
was not wanting to writers, even of
this stamp; but this was in quiet and peaceful
times, times of good government and
perfect security, when men were not universally
called upon by the superior duties
they owe to their country, when the constitution
was in its full vigour, and wanted
not the zealous and united efforts of whole
legions of political labourers, to vindicate
and assert its invaluable privileges.</p>

<p>In those days, if they were threatened
with no invasion from abroad, nor with
popery nor arbitrary power at home; if
magna charta, the declaration of rights,
habeas corpus, and other fundamental
laws of the realm, remained unrepealed in
full force and exertion, they never gave
themselves any farther concern about the
public, but minded what they called their
own affairs such as their respective trades,
arts, callings, professions, thereby to be
enabled to feed, clothe, and lodge themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and their families, and provide for
their children. If they could contrive to
live in peace and plenty at home, and pass
among their customers, their neighbours,
and their friends, for honest, industrious,
good-humoured folks, they thought themselves
at liberty to employ their leisure-hours
in what studies they pleased, and
looked no further. They had no notion
of political refinements, of those delicate
and nicer sensations we feel for the public.
It never entered into their heads to
be perpetually making earnest and anxious
enquiries about the state of the nation; if
the body politic was, upon the whole, sound
and in good health, they were no more
alarmed at every little complaint, than at a
slight cold, or an accidental head-ach.
They had not indeed the same opportunities
of hearing complaints: the book of
knowledge fair, was but half open to them;
the sources of information and instruction
were then neither so frequent nor so
abundant; every remote corner of the
kingdom was not, as it happily is now,
plentifully supplied with political, pure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
refreshing streams, flowing without intermission,
during the whole year, to the
great delight and emolument of the whole
kingdom. Neither were they rich enough
to join in large voluntary contribution for
the feeding, clothing, and support of such
a numerous body of sturdy penmen as are
now in constant pay. Those trusty guardians
of our liberties, oraculous as the priestess
of Apollo; jealous as Argus of the fair privileges
committed to their care; watchful
of our golden treasures as the green dragons
of the Hesperides; faithful and fierce
as the bellua centiceps of Pluto; alarming
as the sacred birds that saved the Capitol;
zealously attached to our service; equally
vigilant in times of security as in danger, in
peace as in the midst of war; ready at a
moment’s warning, on every alarm, to attack
or defend; intrepidly sacrificing to
the public every consideration that the timidity
of other men calls dear to mankind;
like well-disciplined troops, scorning
to loiter away their time in rusty idleness,
daily exercising their arms, performing
all their marches and counter-marches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
evolutions, and firings, with the same skill
and alertness as if the enemy were upon
them.</p>

<p>These advantages were unknown to our
ancestors, and were reserved, among many
other peculiar blessings, for their posterity.
Not that genius, wit, and learning, appear
to have been scarce commodities in those
days; but they laid on their owner’s hands,
for want of purchasers. When the Daily
Advertiser, the St. James’s Evening-Post,
and the Gentleman’s Magazine, were as
much as they could afford to buy, many
thousand hands were lying idle for want of
employers, and many a strenuous and faithful
subject, amply qualified, both from his
talents and his virtues, for the service of
his country, was shut out from the higher
employments which nature had formed
him for; confined, for mere want of
bread, to the narrow sphere of a shop-board
or a counter, or condemned perhaps
for life to the sordid drudgery of some laborious
handicraft trade.</p>

<p>The times are now changed; merit is
no longer in danger of pining in obscurity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the high road to wealth and fame is open
to all their votaries; whether a political
writer be inspired by the genuine spirit of
patriotism, inflamed with a fervent zeal
for the honour of his king and his country;
whether he aspires to high dignities,
places, pensions, or reversions; or
whether he be a simple candidate for food
and raiment, it is his own misfortune or
fault, not the public’s, if he fails: for it
is notorious to every man of common observation,
that the arts and sciences, the
children of genius and learning, thrive and
increase in proportion to the increase of
our manufactures, trade, and commerce;
which enable a rich, indulgent, and munificent
public to cherish, support, and
honour them. The immense wealth acquired
by these means within these few
years, and scattered with generous profusion
over the whole kingdom, is not more
remarkable, nor more amazing, than the
rapid progress which the arts of painting,
sculpture, building, gardening, music, engraving,
&amp;c. have made in the same period.
Our artists begin already to rival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and surpass the most celebrated artists of
Europe, and bid fair to confer on their
country as much honour and renown, as
those in the ages of Leo X. and Lewis XIV.
did on France and Italy.</p>

<p>Hitherto, however, they have not
reached that lofty summit; being rather
subordinate arts, the arts of elegance and
ornament, than of real and intrinsic use:
they are neither held in such general estimation,
nor so liberally rewarded; and
are therefore not cultivated with the same
zeal and assiduity, as others of more immediate
benefit and importance to society.</p>

<p class="poetry p0">
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera, &amp;c.<br />
Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento.<br />
Hæ tibi erunt artes,&mdash;&mdash;</i><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">was an ingenious compliment paid by Virgil
to his countrymen; a grave, serious, sober,
virtuous people, like ourselves, devoted to
the great interests of their country, absorbed
in public affairs, and preferring the
study of government, or the art of politics,
to all other arts whatever: to this
art they were indebted for their prudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
generosity, fortitude, and magnanimity;
for their excellent laws and institutions;
for their admirable skill in negociations;
for the treaties they made, the victories
they gained, and for their conquests, in
almost every corner of the known world;
for all which they are so deservedly celebrated
and renowned. Part of the Roman,
and even part of the Grecian art of politics,
happily escaped the injuries of time
and accident, and continued, for many
hundred years, the constant theme, admiration,
and example of all writers on politics;
but as we lament the irreparable
loss of the greater part of the productions
of those wise and venerable ancients in
philosophy, history, poetry, &amp;c. so we must
despair of recovering the most valuable
part of their writings on the art of politics.
The Anticatones of Cæsar; the Acta Diurna,
which Cicero expressly mentions to
have read daily, with great delight and instruction,
as containing, Senatus consulta,
edicta, fabulæ, rumores, &amp;c. and ten
thousand writings of the same kind, are
all lost in one common ruin; and of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
these daily Papers and Pamphlets, not one,
that I know of, is remaining, to discover
to us the stupendous genius and art with
which they must have been composed, to
produce the astonishing effects they manifestly
appear to have done, especially in the
latter times of these republics; such as, by
a sort of magic, to fascinate the understandings
and passions of the people, to
wield at their pleasure that unwieldy body
the multitude; to compel them, as it were,
to choose or to dismiss what ministers the
authors of them thought proper; to enact
or to repeal what laws they pleased; to
provoke them to war, or cajole them into
peace; in short, to persuade them that
Scipio was a knave and a traitor, Aristides
a common cheat, Cato a coward, and Socrates
a sodomite and an impostor; whereas
all the historians, biographers, philosophers,
and poets of those countries, agree
in representing them as the justest, the
greatest, and the wisest men of the times in
which they lived, or indeed in the times
that succeeded. It is manifest, likewise,
that the very people themselves had, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
many years together, possessed the same
opinion of them; that they were universally
beloved, honoured, and revered,
until they were dismissed or had resigned,
and that after their executions or deaths,
they were as universally and sincerely lamented.</p>

<p>If the great affairs of the world were
uniform and consistent, the opinions of
the people would, no doubt, have been
suffered to remain so too; but they being,
from their very nature, subject to perpetual
change and fluctuation, the political
writers of those days saw that it was their
business and duty to adjust themselves to
accidents and events, and to the times
which they strived to reform; to have recourse,
like Proteus, to every art, and to
assume every imaginable shape. Now it is
well known, that it was no uncommon thing
among their countrymen, chearfully to sacrifice
their own fortunes, or the fortunes of
other men, their own or other people’s mothers,
wives, children, friends, or acquaintances,
nay, themselves, as often as the more
important affairs of the state required it: thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
when it became indispensably necessary for
the preservation of liberty and the constitution,
or for the immediate salvation of
their country, they very gravely persuaded
and prevailed on the people to impeach
Scipio and Aristides, to banish Cicero, to
poison Socrates, dissolve the union they
had so eagerly courted with Sparta or Arpinum,
to curse the very memories of all
those able and upright counsellors who had
advised it, to revile and insult every Lacedemonian
or Samnite that had been invited
to their hospitality, and at length to drive
them out of their houses, and out of their
cities.</p>

<p>There are people who pretend, that the
Clouds, a dramatic performance of Aristophanes,
is a specimen of the art of
writing of which I have been speaking.
In my own opinion, however, whether
considered as a mere comedy, or as a political
composition, it is such a pert insipid
piece of buffoonery, written so much
in the true spirit of our Grub-street, that
it could have no manner of chance to produce
the effect it is supposed to have designed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and does not at all account for the
problem, being, in every respect, much
inferior to our own writings of that kind,
the Nonjuror, and Beggar’s Opera. We
know, in short, as little of their art of
political writing as of their music; the
rise, progress, and perfection of both
seem to have been owing to the same
causes.</p>

<p>In arbitrary and despotic governments,
fear, as Montesquieu justly remarks, is the
principal engine of government; there
the sophi, or the grand seignior, or the
dey, is the sole legislator; the only person
who has studied the art of politics, being
the only person who is called upon by
his country to practise it. This sort of
writing being principally applied to the
great purposes of provoking or of appeasing
the people; of awaking them,
or laying them asleep; of blinding them,
or restoring them to sight at pleasure, is
wholly useless in a country where it is
the sovereign’s business to command; the
subjects duty to act, to suffer, and to
obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>But in the free governments of Greece
and Rome, all ranks, degrees, and orders
of men, patricians and plebeians, from
the highest birth, alliance, and properties,
down even to tinkers and coblers,
were all either immediately or remotely
perpetually employed, and at work
upon the constitution; busily and anxiously
examining into every part of it; repairing
any breaches that might have been made
in it by time or neglect; framing new
laws, or repealing old ones; appointing
ministers, statesmen, generals, admirals,
&amp;c. for all the various departments of
peace and war; choosing faithful, eloquent,
zealous tribunes, the great defenders
of the liberties of the plebeians;
voting for peace or for war, &amp;c. By this
means the arts of politics and music (of
which latter I shall speak hereafter) became
the immediate business, employment,
and duty of every individual; as they both
had been found, from long experience, indispensably
necessary for the repose, security,
and duration of the state. The constitution
and the inhabitants of Great
Britain in these present times, very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
resemble those of which I have been speaking.
The same instruments of government,
therefore, are as necessary here as
they were there; now as they were then:
no encouragement, of course, has been
wanting to these arts; and I cannot,
upon this occasion, forbear to congratulate
with my countrymen upon the happy progress
that has been made in them, even
within these very few years; more especially
as our professors had no examples of
such sort of writing before them for their
imitation. It would be no difficult matter
to produce an hundred proofs, both of their
skill and their success. There are, for instance,
few people, at this time of day, so
infatuated as to doubt that it is to them
we are indebted that this our native land,
with all her revenues, dignities, honours,
employments, posts, pensions, reversions,
&amp;c. was not seized, three or four years ago,
by the violent hands of Scotchmen, who,
according to the prophecy of a late holy
prophet, had formed, like the Goths and
Vandals, and other fierce and enterprizing
people of the North, the bold design of a
general emigration, had already (as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
currently reported) begun their flight, and
were descried at a great distance (as appeared
from many affidavits made at that
time by men of known veracity) like a
huge cloud extending from East to West,
from North to South, hovering over the
fair harvests of our lands and our labours,
and ready to settle and devour them! As
the task assigned to our guardian polemists,
upon this occasion, was difficult and arduous,
so the services they performed were
signal and eminent. The Genius of England
had been, at no time, more confident
of repose, nor had ever fallen into a
profounder sleep: it required the loud
roarings and shrieks of a multitude to
awaken him; and when at length he
awoke, it called for the united efforts of
argument, wit, eloquence, eager affirmation,
positive assertion, repeated oaths, and
imprecations, to make him listen for a moment
to a report, which he treated most
imprudently and unwarily with contempt
and laughter. The greater part of his
most faithful counsellors were unhappily
under the same fatal delusion, and heard
it with the same scorn and neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Strange as this dangerous confidence and
supineness will appear to posterity, yet it
was not altogether unaccountable; for as
the inhabitants of the South and of the
North of Great Britain had been accustomed
to live together, for a great number
of years before, in such perfect harmony
and mutual affection, that it was no easy
matter to distinguish the one from the
other, either by their stature, complexion,
language, dress, modes, education, manners,
arts, sciences, religion, principles of
morals, or of government; as the injuries
and devastations of their former wars with
each other, which, as well as I can remember,
they equally and reciprocally suffered
and offered, were mutually forgotten
and forgiven, and had left little traces, but
in history and on record; as they had
shewn the same zeal for civil and religious
liberty; had rushed foremost, and
begun the first attack upon the common
enemies to both; had enabled us,
by engaging first as principals, and afterwards
as confederates, to oppose their furious
and dangerous invasions, to repel
them as often as they were attempted, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
finally to rout and discomfit them for ever;
as they had lent us their assistance likewise,
with the same alacrity, in raising that
curious and wonderful fabric which we
built on the ruins of the ancient structure;
venerable and awful as the Capitol, and
composed of more durable materials,
which, in the course of many centuries,
had by turns been often secretly undermined,
treacherously betrayed, and openly
and violently battered, and by turns, as
often as we had opportunity or abilities,
recovered and repaired. As it was reared
with their hands, and cemented with their
blood, as well as with our own, they were
invited, by the advice of our counsellors,
most renowned for their gravity, penetration,
wisdom, and virtue, to all the advantages
of its protection; but they had a
Capitol of their own, which, although it
was neither so splendid, nor so magnificent,
nor so vast, yet they had that superstitious
love and veneration for it which is common
to all nations, and which nature,
education, and habit, has deeply implanted
in the hearts of all honest men and good
citizens, and were unwilling to quit it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
We knew by experience that they were
powerful allies; we thought them faithful
friends, and we had found on record,
mortifying as it was to remember it, that
as often as they had been provoked or insulted,
they had been formidable and dangerous
enemies. We plainly saw that it
was our interest they should be united to
us for ever; and all our political arts and
resources were employed to convince them
it was theirs too. At last, after large promises
and assurances of honours, riches,
and everlasting love; they were prevailed
on, although reluctantly, to consent. The
advantages we derived from this union, by
the abilities and virtues of their statesmen,
the valour, skill, thirst of glory, and spirit
of enterprize of their sailors and soldiers;
the genius, wit, taste, eloquence, and
learning of their divines, philosophers, historians,
poets, lawyers, physicians, &amp;c.,
the inventions of their artists; the industry
of their merchants, &amp;c. had been, until
lately, manifest to all men, and were freely
acknowledged by all men, who possessed
or pretended to candor and impartiality.</p>

<p>Men, indeed, conversant with history,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
knew well enough that the Goths, Vandals,
Huns, Saracens, Turks, and Moors, had
been invited to an alliance, in times of
emergency and extreme danger; some of
them by the Romans, others by the Spaniards,
Italians, &amp;c. that they, at first,
fought for them, and defended them
against their enemies; but turned, at
last, their arms against the very people
who had called them in, invaded
their properties, usurped their governments,
and finally destroyed their constitution.
But they reflected at the same
time that these people were not formed
to live long together on any good terms
of mutual friendship, and confidence, being
neither born under the same climate,
nor of the same colour, nor educated in
the same principles of manners, morals,
nor government, nor speaking the same
language, nor worshipping the same god.
There could not, therefore, be any stable
principle of union in so heterogeneous a
mixture: the interest of the one was to
disband them like mercenaries, when the
service was over; the policy of the other,
to use the opportunity their arms had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
them to remain where they were, and
seize all they could get.</p>

<p>Some few politicians, nevertheless, there
were among us (the very politicians I have
so justly extolled) of deeper penetration and
more enlarged views, who scrupled not to
give shrewd hints, that the alliance between
England and Scotland teemed with the same
mischief; but these insinuations were supposed
to be the effects of private interest, or
of a malignant disposition; or, at the best,
the mere pleasantries of idle wags. Nor indeed
(if what has been said of the North
Britons be admitted) ought it to pass for
matter of wonder that what we emphatically
call the Union, should appear to vulgar
eyes totally different from the alliance
between the people of whom I have been
speaking. It was, therefore, the prevailing
and common opinion, that an Englishman
might, with equal reason, be jealous of a man
born in another country or city, or of his next
door neighbour, or of his brother, as of a
Scotchman. Now no man can be found so
foolish as to own such a jealousy, how much
soever he may feel it; all men being agreed
to allow, that there cannot be a surer mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of a shallow understanding, and a wicked
temper; yet it sometimes happens in private
families, that the elder son, either from the
vanity or overweening fondness which people
feel for their first productions, or from
novelty, or the ambition of transmitting to
posterity their names, titles, and possessions,
is dandled and cockered in his infancy,
pampered in his childhood, flattered in his
follies, and indulged in his vices; during his
youth exempted from the drudgery of
reading and study, from the labours and
anxieties of trade, and from the fatigues
and dangers of war; secured from want by
the liberality of his parents, and from
all solicitude about the future, but for the
speedy removal of one only obstacle to the
accomplishment of all his wishes; carefully
trained, indeed, to those noble principles
which create authority and distinction
in the great scenes of pleasure and idleness;
but instructed in no other. The
fate of his younger brother is frequently
very different: if he be fed, cloathed, and
taught, it is all he has a right to expect; he
must be flogged to his books; his passions,
follies, and vices, must be perpetually controuled,
that they may not obstruct his fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in the world; and he must be, after
all this, compelled to some profession, art,
or business, to keep him from starving, when
his parents cannot or will not contribute
any longer to his support. Now if he should
chance, in the course of such an education,
to learn the habits of temperance, frugality,
and industry, and qualify himself,
after the hard labour of many years, for the
employment or profession of a divine, a
statesman, a lawyer, a physician, an artist,
a merchant, &amp;c. one would naturally suppose
that his elder brother would rejoice in
his success; and being himself totally ignorant
and incapable of all these matters,
would court his assistance, as often as his
business, his pleasures, his affairs, his
health, his own preservation, or the safety
and interest of his country required. Something
of this sort does now-and-then happen,
I believe, among the numerous families
in Great Britain; and although
there are not wanting even multitudes of
elder brothers, of the highest distinction
and eminence in every acquisition, accomplishment,
talent, and virtue, yet they have
not been found so abundant as to answer all
the exigencies either of private or public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
life; recourse, therefore, must be had to
somebody: by this means the younger
brothers came to be employed occasionally;
sometimes the elder and the younger
were employed indiscriminately; but the
preference was commonly shewn to the
elder, according to that prevailing alacrity
with which most men fly to the aid of the
rich and the powerful.</p>

<p>This, as far as I have been able to discover,
was supposed to be pretty much the
case with the South and the North Britons,
until of late.</p>

<p>When his present majesty (the first of our
kings born in this country since the Union)
succeeded to the throne, he was most graciously
pleased to assure his subjects, that,
among many other peculiar felicities of his
reign, he gloried in the name of Briton.
The name of Briton was impartial, general,
and comprehensive in its meaning, and
most equitable in its intention. The prudent
and wise application of it, on that
great occasion, was acknowledged by all men
(and all good men united in their hopes)
that the time was now come when all distinctions,
excepting the eternal distinctions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of vice and virtue, would be buried in oblivion;
when every honest man, and every
good citizen, should be intitled to his majesty’s
protection; and if his talents happened
to be useful to the state, to his royal
favour and bounty. No prince had ever
ascended the throne of these kingdoms so
universally beloved and revered. His dominions
every where resounded with mutual
congratulations, with the praises of so
excellent a monarch; and the breasts of all
his subjects were filled with the most exulting
hopes of a long and glorious reign.
These halcyon days were soon succeeded by
a furious tempest, that had well nigh overwhelmed
us (in the very bosom of repose and
tranquillity)! A most execrable and horrid
plot was said to be discovered (which had
been long formed) concealed with the same
secrecy, and designed to have been executed
with more universal and fatal effect, than the
famous gunpowder plot. Much pains has
been taken to get at the bottom of this
plot; but no exact information, at least that
I know of, has yet been obtained of it, or
of the conspirators. Some pronounced it
a democratical plot, others affirmed it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
be an aristocratical plot; some pretended
it was a tory plot, others protested it was a
whiggish plot; many offered large betts
that they would prove it to be a jacobite
plot, some archly squinted at it as a popish
plot; but the true and zealous friends
of their country swore by G&mdash;d it was a
Scottish plot: there were, indeed, a few,
who insinuated that it was no plot at all;
but as these latter were known to be inveterate
enemies to all such names and denominations,
they were of course supposed
to bear no good-will to their countrymen;
there not being more than one
in a thousand of them who does not call
himself by one or other of these names:
so that their opinion was almost universally
treated with the contempt and scorn it deserved.
The opinion that it was a Scottish
plot I think, prevailed very generally in that
part of Great Britain called England, and
in Berwick upon Tweed. Then it began
gradually to be doubted, then to be wholly
disbelieved, for even a considerable time:
happily it is now at this very day revived;
and, by the fervent zeal and marvellous
skill of those faithful guardians of our liberties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
whom I have formerly spoken of,
the eyes of all men are at length opened,
and nobody is found so mad as to doubt it.
For notwithstanding all I have said, and
said most innocently, of our brethren of
Scotland (an appellation we fondly gave
them in times of our great distress) for
the truth of which I beg leave to appeal
to the honour and consciences of all my
countrymen, who have ever happened to
see them, converse with them, employ
them, serve with them, in the navy or the
army; hear them in the pulpit, at the
bar, or in either houses of parliament;
observe their buildings, engravings, and
other arts; or read their productions; yet
no true lovers of liberty can be too circumspect
nor too vigilantly on their guard
against the danger even of possibilities;
it being an established maxim among all
politicians of free countries, that Credulity
is the mother of Danger, as she is the
daughter of Stupidity and Ignorance, and
has been the total ruin of many nations:
for proof of which they produce examples
from the histories of all countries; such as
the secret machinations of many the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
illustrious patricians and wealthiest plebeians
against the constitution of Rome, in
the times of Marius, Sylla, Catiline,
Pompey, and Cæsar, which, by the credulity
of the people, lurked for a long while
undiscovered and unsuspected, until it
burst forth on a sudden in open and violent
attacks, and ended in the total ruin of it;
yet all these were Romans. The same
wicked designs were said to have been
formed, not long since, by the Jesuits in
France and Portugal, and to have been almost
ripe for execution; but were happily
discovered before it was too late, and prevented;
yet these Jesuits were all Frenchmen
or Portuguese. Neither are there
wanting examples of this sort, even in the
history of our own country, in the reigns
of Charles I., Charles II. and James II.
The greater part of the nobility, gentry,
divines, and lawyers, were detected in a
conspiracy against the lives and properties
of their fellow-subjects, and the religion
and liberty of this kingdom was dragged
to the very brink of destruction; yet these
conspirators appear, to the best of my remembrance
of the histories of those times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to have been all, with the exception of a
few Scotchmen, Englishmen. These undeniable
facts are sufficient to warn us
against the fatal consequences of credulity,
and the danger of trusting to the outward
appearances I have been describing, however
fair. Let us not, therefore, shut our
ears to the cries of the streets, nor turn
away our eyes from the lamentations of the
news-papers. Let us not be cozened by
the arts of crafty and designing men, who
maliciously and falsely represent them as
the counterfeit tears, the groans and wailings
of hired mourners; the snarling, roaring,
and howling, of ravenous faction; or
the hooting, cackling, and braying, of a
wayward and deluded mob: they are the
generous and noble calls of liberty; the
genuine voice of the venerable and sacred
multitude, neither provoked by private
resentment, nor bribed by promises, nor
awed by fear, nor urged by hunger, nor
sold for gain.</p>

<p>I have read almost every Pamphlet and
Paper that has been published within these
five years on political subjects, with equal
delight and astonishment at the deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
comprehensive judgment, wit, spirit, and
humour, with which many of them are
manifestly written; and I congratulate with
my countrymen, on the rapid progress we
are making in this art. Their erudition
I have not mentioned, it having been discovered
to be of no use at all in the knowledge
or exercise of this art. It is an observation
of the great lord Bacon, that a
man will never get to the end of his journey,
if he happens to mistake the way,
and go the wrong road; which he has
clearly proved in his immortal treatises,
Novum Organum, and De Augmentis Scientiarum.
Now, men had been taught to
believe, until very lately, before the discovery
of a direct road, and a short cut, that
the composition of a professed politician required
as many and as great a variety of
ingredients, as Cicero’s orator, or the
knight-errant of Don Quixote: accordingly
the great baron Montesquieu confesseth,
That after the hardy study and
drudgery of twenty-five years, by day and
by night, consumed in the production of
two small volumes; he believed them, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
mature revisal, unworthy of the public;
in a fit of despair dashed them against the
wall; and had not the wall, as he affirms,
returned them, they would never have
been heard of. Since this discovery was
made, which I shall explain hereafter, it
has been found out, to the saving of much
labour, that the study of ancient and modern
history, laws, treaties, political systems,
&amp;c. is mere loss of time, and downright
pedantry. There are very few of
our modern politicians to be seen now adays,
bestrewed with learned dust, like
Pope’s politician; or smelling of the lamp,
like Demosthenes; or lean, like Cassius,
with constant meditation; or pale and
blind with poring over Tacitus, Aristotle,
Plato, Montesquieu, Harrington, Sidney,
or Locke. They have heard that these
books contain nothing more than a parcel
of crude maxims, or the idle dreams of
unpractised pedants and schoolmen; declamations
on liberty, which any man in this
country may learn at his leisure, in the first
company he chances to meet, over a dish
of coffee, or over a bottle; general arguments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
in behalf of the rights of mankind,
which, according to Cicero, every
man is taught by instinct; Est igitur hæc
judices non scripta, sed nata lex, quam non
didicimus, accipimus, legimus; verùm ex
naturâ ipsâ, arripuimus, hausimus, expressimus;
and the visions of vain projectors,
stuffed with ridiculous notions,
and impracticable doctrines; such as that
it may not be altogether safe nor proper for
the whole body of a great nation, any
more than for any private person, to eat
or drink, or sleep, or dress, or sing, or
dance, or game too much: that it is possible,
even for a maritime power, to carry
on too much trade: that drunkenness,
adultery, bribing, and perjury, at elections,
are not very commendable practices: that
even annual parliaments, nevertheless, may
be more eligible than septennial ones, especially
as many of its members may happen
to learn as much of the business of the senate
at the end of six months as at the conclusion
of seven years: that a standing
army, in time of peace, may be dangerous
to liberty, unless it should be voted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the legislative power, although the officers
who composed it were forty times
more valiant than the rest of their fellow-subjects,
and just as honest and virtuous as
ninety-nine in a hundred of them; tamen
miserrimum est posse si velit: that a
militia cannot well be too numerous,
even though the consumption of silk, or
velvet, or lace, or ribbands, or trinkets,
should be thereby considerably diminished,
and even though it should be necessary to
discipline it on the seventh day of every
week: that it may be possible in the nature
of things for large fleets to transport
armies an hundred miles, and land them
safely within sixty miles of a great, unwarlike,
and defenceless capital: that the
king, even of a free people, may be legally
and constitutionally possessed of certain
instruments, engines, and powers, of
unfailing efficacy, in times of general depravity;
by means of which, if he chance,
instead of being the friend and father of
his people, to be wicked, an usurper, and a
tyrant, he may gain over, to any purpose he
pleases, the souls and bodies of three-fourths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of them: that a free people, not clearly discerning
the reciprocal duties of protection
and obedience, and prone to confound the
frenzy of sedition with the modesty of true
liberty, may, peradventure, tumultuously
and violently obstruct the execution of the
known laws of the land, madly insult, in
the public streets, a prince devoted to their
happiness, threaten to blow out the brains
of his friends and servants, and attempt to
overawe the senate, in the very midst of
their public deliberations: that some care
should be taken to prevent such enormities
from creeping into a free state: in short,
as there never had been any man, according
to the unanimous opinion of all divines
and philosophers, who had ever written
on virtue, so perfectly good, but he
might still be made somewhat better; so
all these politicians agreed, that no constitution
was ever so nicely and exactly
framed, but it might possibly admit some
addition or amendment; turpiterque desperatur
quicquid fieri potest. Such (with
many other wild projects and strange fancies
of the like sort) were the whimsical contents
of these famous writings, that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
once made so much noise in the world.
They are now universally neglected and
exploded; they may cry aloud, but no man
regardeth them. As lord Bacon was the
first who shewed the right way to the study
of natural philosophy, so Machiavel, a
man of the most abundant invention, the
most magnanimous resolution, and the
most consummate abilities, was the first
of all the moderns who discovered and
pointed out the direct and short road to
the art of political writing: and as the
Whole Duty of Man was calculated for
the service and benefit of private families,
so Il Principe, that transcendant composition,
that master-piece of the human
genius, was designed, by its immortal author,
for the instruction of royal families
only, as the title of it implies, and consecrated
to the use of kings and princes. It
had no sooner made its appearance among
them, than it was beheld with admiration,
read with avidity, applied with success,
and became the standing rule of politics
among all the potentates of Europe, even
among the kings of Great Britain, until the
Revolution; at which time, by means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
certain innovations, and the introduction
of some new-fangled opinions, it lost all
credit with them, and has never recovered
it to this day; nevertheless, as every man
in this kingdom is intitled to some share in
the government of it, it becomes his duty
likewise to inform himself in what manner
it may be best governed; and in researches
of this kind, these golden rules, which the
king had overlooked, or neglected, or despised,
his subjects happily discovered,
adopted, and practised. That this discovery
has been made, is plain to every body
who has read the Prince of Machiavel, and
the writings of our modern politicians.
Many a man too may remember how much
he was surprized at the novelty of a book,
which, with the most mortifying scorn,
contradicted every opinion and principle
that he had imbibed from his mother, or
had been taught by his father, or his schoolmaster;
the avowed design of it being to
prove, that dissimulation, hypocrisy, fraud,
lying, cruelty, treachery, assassination, and
massacres, were not only commodious and
expedient, on certain occasions, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
they were moral, political, and positive
duties: that all men who did not believe
in these unerring rules, were either fools,
or madmen; and that all nations who had
not, or did not, put them in constant practice,
had been, or must be, infallibly undone.
He did not, indeed, expressly include
slander and defamation by name;
conceiving, probably, that they were fully
comprehended under the articles of lying
and assassination, and that it was a mere
matter of indifference, to ninety-nine men
in an hundred, whether you plundered
them of the characters of honest men, and
good citizens, or knocked out their brains.
Happily for this deluded nation, we have
now among us many disciples of this renowned
politician, of considerable eminence
and proficiency: to their united and
zealous efforts for the common weal, we
are indebted (perhaps before it is too
late) for many useful and salutary discoveries;
such as that ********, under all
the fair appearances of candor and humanity;
the sacred semblance of unblemished
truth, justice, and mercy; the specious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
disguise of the most unambitious and unaffected
love of all his fellow-creatures,
concealed the dark and dangerous designs of
a Tiberius: that *****, who had been
called from retirement and the study of
philosophy to the instruction of his ****,
and who had cajoled all that knew him into
an obstinate belief that he was a nobleman
of distinguished honour and virtue, an accomplished
scholar, a munificent patron of
learning and the arts, an upright counsellor,
an eloquent senator, and an able statesman,
was at the bottom a knave, a dunce, a
traitor, a bashaw, a Gaveston, a Wolsey, a
Buckingham, a Sejanus: that *****, who
had passed almost universally for a patrician
of a most amiable, unreserved, and generous
nature, beloved by his friends and his equals,
for his noble and ingenuous manners; as
courteous and affable to his inferiors, as if
his high birth and fortune had not given him
a right of prescription to insult them; of
great humanity, kindness, and beneficence;
a citizen warmly attached to the interests
of his country; a statesman who had executed,
during half a century, the highest
employments of government with zeal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
integrity; had sat in the councils, and
joined in the suffrages of our patriot ministers,
in the most illustrious period of our
annals, and had spent his whole life in the
uniform support of liberty; that this very
patrician could hardly prove a single claim
either to the virtues of social life, the merit
of public services, the authority of experience,
or even to the common privileges
of age, and deserved to be treated as a very
drunkard, a glutton, and an old woman:
that ****, the arch-magician, who, by virtue
of irresistible spells and incantations,
and by the powers of certain wonderful
and stupendous operations, unknown to all
but himself, and the great magicians of
ancient times, had palmed himself upon the
universal people, not only of Great Britain,
but of almost the whole globe, as the deliverer
of his country, the colossus of the
age; as a philosopher, statesman, and patriot
of the first magnitude; possessing the
genius, experience, eloquence, and consummate
abilities of Pericles, and the virtues
of Epaminondas; the decus imperii,
the spes suprema senatus; was, after all, an
impudent babbler, a profligate villain, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
shameless turncoat, a pensioned hireling, a
fawning minion, a common bully, a pernicious
and treacherous counsellor, a prodigal
squanderer of the blood and treasures
of his fellow-subjects; in short, a madman,
and the perdition of his country.
These and many other discoveries of the
same kind, equally new and important, are
known and familiar to all men, who have
studied the works of our modern politicians,
and sufficiently evince the progress
we have made in this art; yet it appears
to be still far short of the perfection to
which it was carried by the ancients, as I
have already lamented; otherwise, with half
the honest pains they have taken to accomplish
it, the **** would have been d&mdash;&mdash;d
long ago; his friends and servants torn in
pieces one after another, like the De Witts,
and other betrayers of their country, and
their names, like theirs, consigned to perpetual
infamy. As our political writings
unhappily have not yet reached that last
perfection, neither has our music. To
such as have never happened to read the
works of Aristotle, Plato, Quinctilian, and
others of the ancients, what I have to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
about the latter art, may possibly appear
somewhat extraordinary. It is, nevertheless,
very certain, they all considered music
not only as an important, but as an indispensable
part of the qualifications of a politician;
Non igitur, frustra, Plato civili viro,
quem politicon vocant, necessariam musicen
credidit, says Quinctilian. It was one
of the fundamental laws of the republic of
Arcadia, that every man should learn music
until he was thirty years of age. Themistocles
the Athenian was treated as a vain boaster,
for pretending that he could make a great
kingdom of a small one, without availing
himself of its assistance. The rigid and austere
lawgiver of Sparta carefully mingled it with
the composition of his renowned government,
used it on all occasions with incredible
efficacy, and by this means preserved it
from corruption, for seven hundred years.
The wise Socrates studied it with uncommon
assiduity and success: and Pythagoras
boldly declared, that the great system of
the universe was framed on its principles,
and governed by its powers; in short, that
it was all in all. Music, in their acceptation
of the word, indeed, had somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of a more comprehensive meaning than it
has at present; including not only stringed
instruments, wind instruments, rope instruments,
parchment instruments, bone
and iron instruments, but poetry likewise,
and many other sorts of harmony. Of this
marvellous art we have hitherto but imperfect
ideas. Shakespear just hints at it, and
freely gives it as his opinion, that the
man who knows it not, must be a traitor,
a villain, and a murderer. Mr. Pope
too conceived that the music of Mr. Handel
had a remarkable influence over the
passions and affections. Handel learned the
little he knew of this art from the Romans,
who, according to Quinctilian, surpassed
all the nations of the world in their martial
music, as much as they excelled them
in their military achievements; Quid,
autem aliud in nostris legionibus, cornua,
ac tubæ faciunt? Quorum concentus, quanto
est vehementior, tantum Romana in bellis
gloria cæteris præstat. And at this day the
Roman or Italian music, depraved, corrupted,
and enervated as it is become in
the course of two thousand years, has no
inconsiderable power over the minds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
our legislators, statesmen, and warriors.
The force of it has been felt in France, a
country not much renowned for this art.
M. Voltaire insinuates, that a song in the
time of Calvin, the burden of which was,
O Moines, O Moines, &amp;c. contributed
more than any thing to the noble struggle
a part of that country made, for forty
years, in defence of their religious liberty.
So well aware was our Edward I. of its
universal power, that he could never assure
himself of the perfect and lasting conquest
of Wales, until he had murdered all the
Welsh bards. If I mistake not, he attempted
to do the same by the bards of Scotland:
the immortal Ossian escaped him; and his
music, calculated with the most consummate
political art to inspire the breasts of
all his countrymen with every passion, affection,
sentiment, and principle of heroic
virtue, that might make them happy at
home, beloved and respected by their
friends, and terrible to their enemies, the
Norwegians, Irish, or English, was reserved
until some great occasion should call
it forth; and accordingly did not make its
appearance until very lately. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
of the same kind was immediately attempted
by our English bards, with the
wise and benevolent intention of inspiring
and instructing their countrymen; but
not, I believe, with quite the same success.
Some compositions, however, we
have that are not without a considerable
share of merit; among which there is,
for instance, a well-known jig, I cannot
name, that is observed to produce a very
sensible effect upon our young men and
women. Our sportsmen never cease to
shout at, “With hounds, and with horn.”
All men kindle at, “Britons strike home,”
“Britannia rule the waves,” &amp;c. Every
man must have remarked the unusual loyalty
which never fails to appear in the
countenances of a whole audience at the
excellent music of, “God save great
George our king. Happy,” &amp;c. Lullybylero,
according to bishop Burnet, was
sung by every man, woman, and child,
throughout the whole kingdom, until the
very person of every Irishman was contemptible
and odious for near half a century.
And I do not despair that some able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and skilful bard may hereafter arise, truly
penetrated and inspired by the patriot love
we bear our country, and thoroughly inflamed
with that manly and generous indignation
we feel at the very name of a
Scot, who, by means of a song or a ballad,
may awaken the fury of an angry
people, dissolve the union, and cut the
throat of every North Briton in the kingdom.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
